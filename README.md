# DisasterTweetClassification
## AIM: Kaggle hosted a challenge named Real or Not whose aim was to use the Twitter data of disaster tweets, originally created by the company figure-eight, to classify Tweets talking about real disaster against the ones talking about it metaphorically.
## So, I did this classification in the difference way 
  ## 1. Using Bidirectional LSTM
  ## 2. Using Distile-Bert(With Ktrain)
  ## 3. Using Bert
## So, Here Distile-Bert and Bert has given good accuracy
